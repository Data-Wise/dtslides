# Introduction {.section-slide}

## About This Showcase

This presentation demonstrates the capabilities of the **dtslides** extension for Quarto RevealJS. 

It covers:

-   Markdown & Typography
-   Layouts & Columns
-   Code & Syntax Highlighting
-   Math & Equations
-   Custom Theme Classes
-   Interactive Elements

# Typography & Basics

## Text Formatting

We support standard Markdown formatting:

-   **Bold text** for emphasis
-   *Italic text* for nuance
-   ~~Strikethrough~~ for deletions
-   `Inline code` for technical terms
-   [Links to resources](https://quarto.org)

> "Blockquotes are useful for citing sources or highlighting key concepts."

## Lists & Fragments

Lists can be revealed sequentially using fragments:

::: {.fragment}
1.  First item (appears first)
:::
::: {.fragment}
2.  Second item (appears second)
:::
::: {.fragment}
3.  Third item (appears last)
    -   Nested item A
    -   Nested item B
:::

## Slide Sizes {.small-slide}

This slide uses the `.small-slide` class.

-   Content is smaller (80% size).
-   Useful for slides with slightly more content.
-   Still maintains readability.

## Tiny Slide {.tiny-slide}

This slide uses the `.tiny-slide` class (40% size).

1.  This is useful for very dense information.
2.  Reference lists.
3.  Detailed code blocks that need to fit on one screen.
4.  Appendix material.
5.  Item 5
6.  Item 6
7.  Item 7
8.  Item 8
9.  Item 9
10. Item 10

# Layouts

## Multiple Columns

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
### Left Column

This column takes up 50% of the slide width.

-   Point A
-   Point B
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### Right Column

This column also takes up 50%.

-   Point C
-   Point D
:::
:::

## Column Layouts with Images

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="40%"}
**Text & Context**

You can place text on one side to explain a visual element.

-   Explanation 1
-   Explanation 2
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}

## Tabsets

::: {.panel-tabset}
### R Code

```r
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(mtcars, aes(mpg, hp)) + geom_point()
```

### Python Code

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.scatter(mtcars['mpg'], mtcars['hp'])
plt.show()
```

### Analysis

Tabsets allow you to organize content without cluttering the slide. Great for switching between languages or results.

# Code & Output

## R Code Execution

Standard R code blocks with output:

```{r}
#| label: simple-plot
#| fig-height: 4
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg, color = factor(cyl))) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Motor Trend Car Road Tests")
```

## Side-by-Side Code & Output

Using `output-location: column`:

```{r}
#| output-location: column
#| fig-height: 6
# Generate data
x <- rnorm(100)
y <- 2 * x + rnorm(100)

# Fit model
model <- lm(y ~ x)

# Plot
par(mar = c(4, 4, 1, 1))
plot(x, y, pch = 19, col = "steelblue")
abline(model, lwd = 2, col = "darkred")
```

# Math & Equations

## LaTeX Support

Mathematical equations are rendered beautifully using MathJax.

**Inline math:** $E = mc^2$

**Display math:**

$$
\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf{v}) = 0
$$

**Aligned equations:**

$$
\begin{align}
f(x) &= a x^2 + b x + c \\
f'(x) &= 2 a x + b
\end{align}
$$

# Theme Features

## Custom Classes

The `dtslides` theme includes special utility classes:

-   [Alert text]{.alert} for emphasis (`.alert`)
-   [Custom Foreground]{.fg style="--col: #e64173"} (`.fg`)
-   [Highlighted text]{.highlight} (`.highlight`)
-   [Note style]{.note} (`.note`)
-   [Warning style]{.warning} (`.warning`)

## Standard Callouts

::: {.callout-note}
Note callouts are great for non-critical information.
:::

::: {.callout-important}
Important callouts highlight critical warnings.
:::

::: {.callout-tip}
Tip callouts suggest best practices.
:::

## Theme-Specific Callouts

The theme provides custom semantic callouts:

::: {.callout-example}
**Example:**
A worked problem or specific case study.
:::

::: {.callout-question}
**Question:**
A prompt for audience reflection or discussion.
:::

::: {.callout-insight}
**Insight:**
A deeper observation or key takeaway.
:::
